## Key Findings

- **55.6%** of India's population lives >50km from the nearest monitoring station
- Only **24.8%** has adequate access (<25km)
- **45.8%** of high-poverty populations are underserved
- Significant spatial inequity: remote and poor areas lack monitoring
- Poverty-weighted vulnerability highest in underserved regions
